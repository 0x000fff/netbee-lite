Netbee-Lite Documentation
—————————————————————————

Netbee-Lite is a network library supporting packet filtering, capturing and sniffing.
The project is verified under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
Minor revision might be necessary if you are using other versions or distributions of Linux.

Pre-requisite
    * ARM cross-compile toolchain installed
    * bison flex g++ automake autoconf libtool installed

Getting Started
    1. Get netbee-lite source code
	    $ git clone https://github.com/shawnsschen/netbee-lite.git

    2. Compile
	    $ cd netbee-lite/src
	    $ cmake .
	    $ make
    By now you have got the netbee libraries under netbee-lite/bin.

Modification
    This project inherits from Nbee (see at www.nbee.org), which only supports x86 platforms.
    If you want to compile it on x86, just change the cross compile toolchain back to gcc/g++ in CMakeLists.txt.
